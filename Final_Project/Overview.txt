Project Description:
    Our project implements the game of Gomoku, allowing two players to play
    against each other.

In what way is your project appropriate for this class?
  We used various techniques that we learned this this class, including
  Object-oriented programming, functions, loops and conditions, makefile,
  pointers, interaction with users. The project relates closely to the
  concepts that we have covered in the class.

In creating your project, explain what you learned:
  We learned that collaborating on a project needs every member to be able
  to write easy-to-understand codes, and commenting is a very good coding
  practice which makes it much easier when we are connecting our parts.
  In addition, ideas that seem very easy to implement can sometimes be very
  tricky. For example, when we were trying to show the borders of the board,
  it was easy to think of using dashes to surround the board, but when we
  actually wrote the codes, we realized that the indices are hard to keep
  track of and these indices must be consistent in every one of our files.

If you had more time and/or knowledge, what would you do to improve?
  If we had more time and/or knowledge, we would:
  (1) Implement a single player mode and create an AI.
  (2) Add a Graphic User Interface for the program to make it more visually
      appealing.

If someone in the future wanted to attempt this same project, what advice
would you give them, and why?
  We would suggest that all the group members should work closely together
  and write high-quality codes, and make sure everyone understands each
  part of the project. We would also suggest them to make a detailed plan
  before actually writing the programs.
